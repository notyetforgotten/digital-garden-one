- Correct your mistakes always!
- Feynman Technique
	- unable to explain something simply = you are unable to truly understand it
	- teaching others helps develop and deepen your comprehension of a topic

**Part One: Coordinate Systems & Frames of Reference**
One example of a frame of reference is when you stand still on the street and view the cars going past - this is one frame of reference - and another frame of reference would be if you are in the car and it appears that things are moving past you + other cars are slower.  This can be related to Einsteins' relativity.

The cartesian plane is used in daily life (GPS) - it is commonly used with a moving origin to denote a moving frame of reference and the 'v' above signifies a vector.

**Part Two: Vectors**

(velocity vs speed)
- Velocity has the speed in distance/time (magnitude) and direction (just direction of movement)
- Speed only has distance/time and no direction of movement described
- A line often described a vector (on a coordinate plane system)

adding 2 vectors together should form a triangle
x^2 + y^2 = m^2
m=slope
x=vector one
y=vector two
