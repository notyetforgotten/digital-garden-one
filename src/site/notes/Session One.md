- Correct your mistakes always!
- Feynman Technique
	- unable to explain something simply = you are unable to truly understand it
	- teaching others helps develop and deepen your comprehension of a topic

**Syllabus Generalized**

**Part One: Coordinate Systems & Frames of Reference**
One example of a frame of reference is when you stand still on the street and view the cars going past - this is one frame of reference - and another frame of reference would be if you are in the car and it appears that things are moving past you + other cars are slower.  This can be related to Einsteins' relativity.

The cartesian plane is used in daily life (GPS) - it is commonly used with a moving origin to denote a moving frame of reference and the 'v' above signifies a vector.

**Part Two: Vectors**
![Screenshot 2024-06-14 at 8.06.43 PM.png](/img/user/Screenshot%202024-06-14%20at%208.06.43%20PM.png)Vectors have direction, scalars **only** have magnitude
(velocity vs speed)
- Velocity has the speed in distance/time (magnitude) and direction (just direction of movement)
- Speed only has distance/time and no direction of movement described
- A line often describes a vector (on a coordinate plane system)

adding 2 vectors together should form a triangle
x^2 + y^2 = m^2
m=slope=r
x=vector one
y=vector two![Screenshot 2024-06-14 at 8.27.12 PM.png](/img/user/Screenshot%202024-06-14%20at%208.27.12%20PM.png)
small r - magnitude

theta='angle' component in the polar system
**YOU MUST HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF TRIGONOMETRY** (SOHCAHTOA)

using trigonometry, you can convert between the two coordinate systems![Screenshot 2024-06-14 at 8.30.29 PM.png](/img/user/Screenshot%202024-06-14%20at%208.30.29%20PM.png)
2 ways to express a vector - magnitude + direction (polar system) and component form (used in physics for calculation certain things)
A vector in brackets, i.e |V| with an arrow on top, describes the length
the magnitude is the small r

Magnitude and direciton:
- similar to polar coordinates
- angle = defines polar direction
- magnitude = 'radius' of the circle in polar coordinates (r)
Component:
- important for review
- uses trigonometry to a more involved extent

**Addition/Subtraction of Vectors**

- When adding vectors, you should draw them either CW or CCW and NEVER switch directions
	- a head should always meet a tail and vice versa; a head never meets a head and a tail never meets a tail
- The resultant should form a triangle with the two vectors
- Having a right triangle form is ideal; you can use the 90 degree angle in some calculations (or better, the Pythagorean theorem)
	- you can also get the theta angle using trigonometry

relating law of cosines to pythag: cos C = 0 when C is 90
law of sines can be related to triangle inequality

use linear pairs / 45-90-0-135-180 degree angles to find angle C (you are given a and b)
**Review**
- be mindful of your understanding; it is crucial to your performance in this class
- frames of reference describe distance from a certain point using one of two coordinate systems
- vectors have magnitude and direction 
- scalars have magnitude
- there are two coordinate systems
	- polar coordinates imitate the (partial) formation of a circle (theta, r)
	- cartesian coordinates are the system we are used to (x, y)
